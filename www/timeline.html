    This sample demonstrates an example usage of a <a href="../intro/graduatedPanels.html">Graduated Panel</a> to draw ticks and text labels along a timeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Panel uses a <a>Panel.graduatedTickUnit</a> of 1 to represent one day, and ticks are drawn at <a>Shape.interval</a>s of 7 to represent weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Labels are drawn at <a>TextBlock.interval</a>s of 14, or every two weeks. As the timeline is resized, the interval is updated to prevent overlaps.
    Text strings are generated by setting the <a>TextBlock.graduatedFunction</a>to convert from values in the graduated range to date strings.
    Also notice that labels use the <a>GraphObject.alignmentFocus</a>, <a>GraphObject.segmentOrientation</a>,
    and <a>GraphObject.segmentOffset</a> properties to place text below the timeline bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try resizing the timeline: select the timeline and drag the resize handle that is on the right side. Event nodes
    will automatically be laid out relative to the timeline using the <code>TimelineLayout</code>. TimelineLayout converts
    a date to a value, then uses <a>Panel.graduatedPointForValue</a> to help determine where event nodes will be placed.
